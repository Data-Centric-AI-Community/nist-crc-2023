# NIST Privacy Collaborative Reseach 

**The Data-Centric AI Community just launched a small community project to experiment with the [NIST Challenge](https://pages.nist.gov/privacy_collaborative_research_cycle/pages/participate.html)!**


- **Goal:** To learn about Synthetic Data and how it can be used to prepare sensitive private data for public release!
- **Dates:** From April to July. You can also join at any time, follow the weekly plan, and post questions on our Discord.
- **Where:** ***ðŸ¤–-nist-challenge*** channel in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/46wAzZxpFy)
- **Touch Points:** We meet every Friday around 4 PM GTM on the ***ðŸ§ -code-with-me channel*** to discuss the project.

## Overview
ðŸŽ¯ The **overall goal** of the project is to **explore synthetic data** to prepare sensitive private data for public release. 

ðŸ“€ NIST has launched a **benchmark of 3 datasets**, `MA`, `TX` (Texas), and `NATIONAL` which you can use in the project.

ðŸ“Š To provide an **evaluation of the de-identified data** against the target/real data, NIST has created the [`sdnist`](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist) package that can be installed according to the instructions below.

ðŸ’» To **create the de-identified data**, we'll use [`ydata-synthetic`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic) package, explore different model settings and study the effect this has on the final results.

## ðŸ§­ Learning Outcomes
| Week        | What you will learn           | 
| :-------------: |-------------| 
| **1**      |**Goal and objectives of the project.** You'll connect with other learners in the [DCAI Discord Server](https://discord.gg/46wAzZxpFy) and be added to the NIST Team to access the **ðŸ¤–-nist-challenge** channel and receive permissions to collaborate on the GitHub project.|
| **2**  | **Basics of Synthetic Data.** You will learn more about what is synthetic data, how is it generated, what are the main applications.|
| **3** | **Basics of Data Profiling.** You will learn what is data profiling, how to understand your data with descriptive statistics, and what are common data quality issues. You will also **explore the NIST datasets** with [`ydata-profiling`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-profiling) and **preprocess the data** according to your findings.  |
| **4 & 5** | **Generation of Synthetic Data.** You will explore Deep Learning models (Generative Adversarial Networks -- GAN) to generate realistic synthetic data using [`ydata-synthetic`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic).|
| **6 & 7** | **Basics of Evaluating Synthetic Data.** You will explore some strategies to evaluate synthetic data and investigate possible improvements to your solution. We will explore the [`sdnist`](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist) package to evaluate our synthetic data.|
| **8** | **Project Showcase.** You will learn how to best **showcase and publicize your project** in your data portfolio, CV, GitHub, or Medium Account.|
