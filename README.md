# NIST Privacy Collaborative Reseach 

**The Data-Centric AI Community just launched a small community project to experiment with the [NIST Challenge](https://pages.nist.gov/privacy_collaborative_research_cycle/pages/participate.html)!**


- **Goal:** To learn about Synthetic Data and how it can be used to prepare sensitive private data for public release!
- **Dates:** From April to July. You can also join at any time, follow the weekly plan, and post questions on our Discord.
- **Where:** ***🤖-nist-challenge*** channel in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/46wAzZxpFy)
- **Touch Points:** We meet every Friday around 4 PM GTM on the ***🧠-code-with-me channel*** to discuss the project.

## Overview
🎯 The **overall goal** of the project is to **explore synthetic data** to prepare sensitive private data for public release. 

📀 NIST has launched a **benchmark of 3 datasets**, `MA`, `TX` (Texas), and `NATIONAL` which you can use in the project.

📊 To provide an **evaluation of the de-identified data** against the target/real data, NIST has created the [`sdnist`](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist) package that can be installed according to the instructions below.

💻 To **create the de-identified data**, we'll use [`ydata-synthetic`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic) package, explore different model settings and study the effect this has on the final results.

  <summary><b> 📦 How to create and use Virtual Environments?</b></summary>

A lot of troubleshooting arises due to **misalignments between environments and package requirements**. If you're new to data science development, maybe you just install packages unto your global Python environment. This may turn into a lot of headaches when project requirements are conflicting.

[Virtual Environments](https://serpapi.com/blog/python-virtual-environments-using-virtualenv-and-poetry/) are ideal to overcome this issue: they **isolate your installations from the "global" environment**, so that you don't have to worry about conflicts. If you've never used virtual environments for your data science projects, you can start by installing [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). If you need a little convincing that this is a nice tool to have on your belt, then [check this post](https://codesolid.com/conda-vs-pip/?utm_content=cmp-true) comparing `conda` with `pip`, `venv`, and  `pyenv`.

Once anaconda is installed, **creating a new environment** is as easy as running this on your shell:

```bash
conda create --name synth-env python=3.10
```

This creates a new environment called **synth-env** with Python version 3.10.X. You can then switch to this environment by **activating it**:

```bash
conda activate synth-env
```

In this new environment, you can still **call `pip` to install python packages**, such as `ydata-synthetic`:

```bash
pip install ydata-synthetic
```

Now you can open up your **Python editor or Jupyter Notebook** and use the `synth-env` as your development environment, without having to worry with conflicting versions or packages between projects! Once you're done, you can **deactivate the environment** using:

```bash
conda deactivate synth-env
```

  <summary><b> 📊 How to install ydata-profiling and create a Profiling Report?</b></summary>

You may start by **creating your virtual environment and installing the package**:

```bash
conda create -n synth-env python=3.10
conda activate synth-env
pip install ydata-profiling==4.1.2
```

Then, in your Jupyter Notebook or other editor (e.g., PyCharm), **load your Pandas DataFrame** as you normally would and the **generation of the profiling report** is straightforward:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

# Read the data from a csv file (NIST "MA" data in the example)
df = pd.read_csv("ma2019.csv")

# Generate the data profiling report 
original_report = ProfileReport(df, title='Original Data')
original_report.to_file("original_report.html")
```

You can then navigate the report to **investigate the data quality issues** generated, and study the basic **descriptive statistics** of your data!
