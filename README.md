# NIST Privacy Collaborative Reseach 

**The Data-Centric AI Community just launched a small community project to collaborate on the [NIST Challenge](https://pages.nist.gov/privacy_collaborative_research_cycle/pages/participate.html)!**


- **Goal:** Generate synthetic data to prepare sensitive private data for public release
- **Dates:** From April to July
- **Where:** *ðŸ¤–-nist-challenge* channel in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/46wAzZxpFy)


## Overview
ðŸŽ¯ The **overall goal** of the project is to **explore privacy techniques** intended to prepare sensitive private data for public release. 

ðŸ“€ NIST has launched a **benchmark of 3 datasets**, `MA`, `TX` (Texas), and `NATIONAL` which we can use in the experiments.

ðŸ“Š To provide an **evaluation of the de-identified data** against the target/real data, NIST has created the [`sdnist`](https://github.com/usnistgov/SDNist) package that can be installed according to the instructions below.

ðŸ’» To **create the de-identified data**, we'll use [`ydata-synthetic`](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic) package, explore different model settings and study the effect this has on the final results.
